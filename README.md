# How To Compile

*How To Compile*

First, type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mereka-vpu/libcapi-dev
```

Then, navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd libcapi-dev
```

Next, compile the project by running:

```bash
make
```

Finally, install the shared library to `/usr/local/lib` and update the linker cache:

```bash
sudo make install
```

This will copy the `libcapi.so` file to `/usr/local/lib` and run `ldconfig` to update the dynamic linker cache.


This provides a clear set of instructions for both compiling and installing the library.
After that you can use as you like!<br>
